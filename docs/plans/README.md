##  Introduction

The `docs/plans` files contains information relevant to features that will be implemented in the feature, but which have not been implemented currently. Not only will it contain practical information about the code, it will contain a brief summary about the *theoretical* development of the algorithm.

Its contents are formatted as markdown (i.e. `.md` files). 

Remember to properly cite the papers using the appropriate markdown syntax. For example, you can use the following format:

```markdown
- [Paper 1](link_to_paper_1)
- [Paper 2](link_to_paper_2)
- [Paper 3](link_to_paper_3)
```
Make sure to replace "link_to_paper_1", "link_to_paper_2", etc. with the actual URLs or references to the papers you want to cite.
